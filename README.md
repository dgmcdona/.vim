<h1>My .vimrc and plugins</h1>
<h2>Installation</h2>
Simply run the `install.sh` script to create a link between the `vimrc` in this repository's top level directory and the default `.vimrc` file in the home directory.
<h2>Plugins</h2>
Plugins are managed using git submodules cloned inside the bundle directory, and installed at runtime via Pathogen.
